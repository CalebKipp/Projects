# Calebs Personal Project Page
#### All Projects done outside of schoolwork.

#### Listed we have 2 projects so far, both are still currently in progress of being completed and have further scalability.

# Battleship
## Overview
#### This project is a game made in python with plenty of functionality in creating fleets of ships, adding fleets to those ships, custom names etc.
#### There are 2 versions of this projects attached, one is text based, the other is GUI based using the pygame package.
## Progress
#### The text based version of the game is almost completed, it is just missing the battle functionality and the final code cleanup.
#### The GUI based version of the game is no where near completed, currently working on the UI menu for starting the game, hardest part will be the battle functionality screen(Ships shooting each other etc.) 
  
# Keylogger
#### This is a cyber security project that I worked on that is a very basic keylogger program.
## How it works:
#### First we install the .pyw file on target machine, the file then runs in the background and collects key strokes performed by the user of target machine.
#### The collected key strokes then get sent to a firebase full of the text files where keys are written to.
## Pentesting:
#### Tested with multiple softwares to see if they picked up on the malicious spyware.
